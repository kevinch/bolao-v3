    "bolaoDesc2": "We started around 2016 doing them on a piece of paper and I decided to try a digital solution. It does not involve money even if most friends like to agree on a prize for the winner. But that's something the app does not deal with.",
    "bolaoDesc3": "After much research of existing solutions, I came to the reality that none of them was what I expected in terms of UX, design and functionality. That's when I started writing code, around 2017. The app has been growing ever since, fixing mistakes, going through massive updates and design changes. This very version you are on is the major 3, or the third big iteration of the application.",
